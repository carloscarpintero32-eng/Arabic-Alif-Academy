ARABIC VOICE REFERENCE FILES
==============================

This folder contains the reference audio samples for the Arabic voice used
in the Alif Academy app. Keep your source/master voice recordings here.

These files are NOT served by the app — they are for reference only.
Use them as the source when recording or editing new lesson audio files.
